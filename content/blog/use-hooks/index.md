This September I made a decision to step away from my remote software job.  I had been working towards becoming a digital nomad for nearly 2 years so that I could sustainably do what I love: see the world.  I finally reached the goal I had set for myself. However, several months later I had a brief experience which made me realize the boundless potential of the mind, maybe I’ll write about this in the future.  It forced me to realize that when we’re chasing the light at the end of the tunnel, we aren’t experiencing the light that is all around and within us.  This isn’t to say goals are a bad thing, they’re necessary to grow as a person, but if you aren’t living in the present moment with yourself and simply putting in the motions to reach a future objective, you might find yourself reaching that objective and then setting another goal.

When she reached the first hills of the **Italic Mountains**, she had a last
view back on the skyline of her hometown _Bookmarksgrove_, the headline of
[Alphabet Village](http://google.com) and the subline of her own road, the Line
Lane. Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek, then she continued her
way. On her way she met a copy.

### Overlaid the jeepers uselessly much excluding

But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a
few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with
[Longe and Parole](http://google.com) and dragged her into their agency, where
they abused her for their projects again and again. And if she hasn’t been
rewritten, then they are still using her.
